# Simulation-of-the-background-ticket-system

This project aimed to simulate the ticket system's background by Java. You can enter the simulated system as an administrator, reset identification information, and work as a ticketing staff: store new tickets' information from the back-end panel, including ticket's starting point, destination, ticket type, and check any ticket's information.
